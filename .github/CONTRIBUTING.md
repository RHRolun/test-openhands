# Contributing to Our Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project! It's people like you that make our community such a great one.

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:
* **Reporting a bug**
* **Discussing the current state of the code**
* **Submitting a fix**
* **Proposing new features**
* **Becoming a maintainer**

## How to Contribute

We have a few guidelines that will help you get your contribution merged smoothly.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues). Before opening a new issue, please check if one already exists. If it does, please add any additional information to the existing issue.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues). After you've determined this is a new idea, create an issue with the "feature request" template.

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Local Development

To get started with local development, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Clone your forked repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the tests: `npm test`

### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](httphttp://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
