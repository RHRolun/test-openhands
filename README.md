# test-openhands

This repository is for testing the capabilities of [OpenHands](https.github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands), an AI-powered software development agent.

## Objective

The main goal of this repository is to provide a safe and controlled environment to test and verify the code generation and problem-solving abilities of OpenHands. By creating issues and assigning them to the agent, we can observe how it understands tasks, proposes solutions, and implements them.

## How to Use

1. **Create an Issue:**
   - Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue".
   - Provide a clear and descriptive title for the task you want OpenHands to perform.
   - In the description, detail the requirements, acceptance criteria, and any relevant context.

2. **Assign the Issue to OpenHands:**
   - Once the issue is created, it will be automatically picked up by the OpenHands agent.

3. **Monitor the Progress:**
   - You can track the agent's progress by following the comments and pull requests associated with the issue.
   - The agent will provide updates on its plan, implementation, and any challenges it encounters.

## Examples of Test Cases

You can create issues for a variety of tasks, such as:

- **Bug Fixes:** "Fix the broken link in the footer."
- **New Features:** "Add a dark mode toggle to the UI."
- **Code Refactoring:** "Refactor the `utils.js` file to improve readability."
- **Dependency Updates:** "Update the `requests` library to the latest version."

By using this repository, we can continuously evaluate and improve the performance of OpenHands.
